# Woofle's Square-1 Trainer

This is a program that will be used for you to train all things Square-1!

_Eventually._

I've never made a program like this, so it will probably take a long time and be badly coded, but whatever works works right?

This program was inspired by [Squanmate](https://squanmate.cuber.pro/#/algorithm-trainer), which is unfortunately not being maintained anymore. Long live Squanmate!
