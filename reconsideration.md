Hello!

I am reconsidering even creating this entire web app. 

Yes, it is fun to make, but I think I am simply wasting time by creating it since Squanmate already exists.

I may try instead to contribute to Squanmate for any bugs I have found, since the owner of Squanmate, Mika Vilpas, said that the project needs a new maintainer.

That being said, I have no idea how it works, so that would be a full other learning oppurtunity for me.

Maybe I'll take on the challenge eventually, but right now, with college applications and school stuff, I probably won't.

Shoutout to the one or two people who watched/starred this project!
